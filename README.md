# Fuzzy Logic Laboratory Works

Practical implementation of fuzzy logic methods: from expert data collection to defuzzification of fuzzy sets.

## Project Structure

**Lab 1** – Expert Surveys & Membership Functions  
**Lab 2** – Operations on Fuzzy Sets  
**Lab 3** – Defuzzification Methods

Each folder contains:
- `report.pdf` – detailed documentation and conclusions
- `calculations.xlsx` – all computations and visualizations in Excel

## Tools & Methods
- Microsoft Excel (calculations, data visualization)
- Microsoft Word (technical reporting)
- Mathematical framework of fuzzy logic
- Regression analysis, numerical methods
